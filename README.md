## 🔍 Project Scope
- **Mind Mapping**:  
  Created mind maps to represent and analyze the **“Add Driver’s License”** functionality, facilitating the identification of key test scenarios.  

- **Equivalence Partitioning & Boundary Value Analysis**:  
  Defined equivalence classes and boundary values for the **First Name** and **Last Name** input fields in the driver’s license form, ensuring efficient and comprehensive test coverage.  

- **Flowchart Modeling**:  
  Designed flowcharts to model the **price and duration calculation process** in the car-sharing functionality, improving visualization and understanding of the system flow.  

- **Test Case Development**:  
  Developed test cases focused on validating the accuracy of **price and duration calculations** in the car-sharing service, ensuring correct implementation of business logic.
